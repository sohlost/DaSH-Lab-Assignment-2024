## Development Assignment

### Level 1

I mainly referred to the OpenAI's quickstart guides for this pretty simple code.
Just make sure you have set an OpenAI key as an environment variable before running it and have the OpenAI library installed
```
pip install openai
```
```
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

### Level 2
I used the basic HTTP sockets, used a 12 client - 1 server approach, each client responsible for one prompt and the rest is done as specified. 

### Level 3



Make sure that docker-compose and docker are both installed to run this. Do set an OpenAI API key in the Server Dockerfile to run this.
